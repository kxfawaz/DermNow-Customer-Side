A web application that generates personalized weekly meal plans based on dietary needs, budget, and kitchen inventory. Users log the ingredients they have, and MealMate recommends recipes while updating grocery lists automatically.

### ❌ Idea 2 — GamerHub: Matchmaking & Community for Gamers
A social platform connecting gamers with similar skill levels, interests, and available play times. Features would include matchmaking, chat rooms, and player statistics from external services.

### ✅ Idea 3 — DermHub: Tele-Dermatology Consultation Platform (Selected Project)
A web application that allows patients to submit online dermatology consultations by selecting a primary skin concern, answering guided follow-up questions, and uploading images. Doctors can later review these submissions via a separate admin dashboard. This idea was selected because it demonstrates full-stack development skills including secure form workflows, image handling, database design, and deployment within the capstone timeline.
